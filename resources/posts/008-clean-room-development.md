This one's all about the music. What if you had to rewrite your
software after every release?

**In This Episode:**

 - The conceptual difficulties of other peoples' code, even when those
   other people are you.
 - Legacy code and your own conceptual traps.
 - Legacy code and demon possession.
 - Legacy code and multiple personality disorder.
 - What if you have to rewrite your code for each fix or deployment?
 - "Write a new version of the code, minus the bug."
 - Lego oriented programming
 - Binary vs texty interop
 - ClassCastException vs sloppy parsers.
 - "No, no. All shall match!"
 - Log it and move on.
 - Loosely coupled components vs statically-typed messages.
 - The freedom to write crap code.
 - The side-tracking concerns of the typical code review.
 - "Okay, I'm having a connection."
 - Guitar!
 - Writing code as performance.
 - Improvisation, instruments, scores.
 - Rewrite as process is kinda like jazz improv over a chart of chord
   changes, right?
 - Sax might work better than a symphony orchestra when you need to
   improv.
 - My secret weapon is Clojure.
 - Banjo!
 - "And then I come in with my ukelele and just get upset."
 - Ukelele!
 - Guard rail programming (driving by unit tests).
 - The interface docs are the app, not the code, not the
   implementation.
 - The transitive nature of object oriented spaghetti
 - How to decouple? Look to the data.
 - State data vs event data (moments lost like tears in the rain vs
   the eternal).
 - Injecting your dependencies. Is that a euphamism?
 - Turing complete config langage. No!
 - "All you get is English."
 - If all you have to spec components is English, components have got
   to be simple.
 - Built-in monitoring over extensive testing, the app's business
   logic is to test itself?
 - Ultimately, design (the score or the changes) is king.
 - Design is "how it works".
 - "I was hoping you were going to say something brilliant. Uh...."
 - Nexi of information.
 - What's the difference between technical debt (bankruptcy) and not
   having the source code?
 - "Technical debt is worse than having to rewrite from scratch every
   time."
 - "Whenever 'c' came along, I played 'c'. Then I was silent."
 - The first thing to jettison with multiple rewrites are the
   pointless abstractions.
 - Improvisation + experience.
 - Onboarding new devs via rewriting.
 - "The knife dropped itself from my hands."
 - "The code went off the deep end."
 - "_We_ chained ourselves to the technical debt."
 - "The business didn't let us fix it."
