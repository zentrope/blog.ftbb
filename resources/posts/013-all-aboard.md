In our last episode, we took as our starting point the notion that
[Scrum][sc] and/or [Agile Software Development][asd] is more about how
to manage tasks than about how to design software, both for quality,
and for the humans who need to maintain and extend it. We explored
ways of getting design into the process as much as possible.

In this episode, we continue the theme by starting with the notion
that Scrum/Agile, again, for all its success as a task management,
estimation and communication strategy, has nothing to say about
building and maintaining a great team.

You might find yourself joining a team successfully leveraging Scrum
for all its worth yet be at a loss as to how you can contribute. It's
not that you don't understand the process. That part's easy. It's
that, well, there's the software, the ecosystem, the politics, the
personalities, the design and the architecture. The technical debt.

How might you onboard a team member when the project is complicated
and the existing team are battle-hardened verterens? Does the nature
of the project &mdash; its design &mdash; make this any easier? How do
you define success for the new guy? Is there a place for ownership and
responsibility?
