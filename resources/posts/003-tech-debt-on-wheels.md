What if you were required to write a prototype for every significant
development of your software system?

**In this episode:**

  * Prototypes as the only means of proposal
  * New, bootstrappy architectures vs old, established architectures
  * Prototype the non-code parts of the problem
  * Prototypes as risk management for legacy, debt-encrusted systems
  * Can you really prototype a monolithic mountain of madness?
  * No prototyping without loose coupling?
  * What is a prototype anyway?
  * Distributed architectures and prototyping
  * Prototype first as an antidote to the monolith
  * A paper prototype is misleading
  * Prototypes reveal the hidden horror beneath a beautiful diagram
  * The value of a pre-prototype discussion
  * Wherefore art thou estimation?
  * Changing the meaning of change
  * Prototypes: the enemy of status-quo or the safest way to grow?
