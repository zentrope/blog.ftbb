What if you can't duplicate your production stack for testing and so
on? For instance, factory software? I'm starting to think this whole
podcast is, ultimately, about design.

**In This Episode:**

 - Steel mills
 - Stackless programming (and we ain't talkin' 'bout push/pop).
 - What if you can't run your software except in production?
 - You can test but you can't run.
 - Your interfaces can never be too thin.
 - Adapters outside the walled garden of perfection.
 - The immutable log of perfection.
 - What's the difference between data streaming in from hardware, or
   replayed log data?
 - The wall as observation post.
 - You gotta go batch.
 - The golden nugget and the matrix.
 - Everybody gets a copy!
 - How to engineer bugs for performance review goodness.
 - "This whole things screams, 'Messaging! Messaging!'"
 - "This Facebook thing is confusing me a bit."
 - How many gamma bursts per angstrom?
 - Human vs machine interface and the idea of a command protocol
   expressing user intentionality. Beep boop.
 - Human typeable protocol, the ultimate human/machine
   interface. (Well, outside of brain implants. Maybe.)
 - The Hardware shouldn't know about the System, the System shouldn't
   know about the Hardware. (Or Facebook.)
 - If software devs and hardware devs agree on a simple protocol they
   can fake the rest.
 - Any time you can remove dependencies from the system, it's good.
 - Hardware interfaces are one thing, but why not do the same thing
   with remote software interfaces? (Say, Facebook!)
 - Facebook is hard. Ware.
 - The footzy-boo camera, not that old whatever-whatever camera.
 - System integration should be about intentions, not implementation
   details.
 - Distributed adapters mean incremental upgrade. No down time!
 - Erlang pretty much got all this right long ago.
 - Everyone needs to learn to walk, even though "walking" has been
   solved.
 - That's right. Steel mills to data warehouses.
 - We don't build one-off lamps, we build lamps that morph and evolve.
 - It's about the data that flows, not the nodes it flows through.
 - Does it come down to separation of expertise as well as concerns?
 - "I thought we were experts on everything."
