Our second podcast. This one got away from us in length, but it all
adds up. Somehow. Does a project's implementation strategy affect team
dynamics? What if you couldn't include tests in your source tree?
Digressions abound!

**In this episode:**

  * Implications of architecture on team dynamics
  * Programmer apathy
  * The programmer hero
  * The need to add value
  * What if you couldn't use unit tests?
  * Confidence
  * Metrics, instrumentation, data gathering and the real world
  * Build systems just build
  * App testing applications
  * Testable apps
  * Black box testing
  * Domain experts and the unautomatable
  * What can be confidently tested isn't worth testing?
  * Prepare for the un-preparable
  * Breaking the build
  * Baroque unit tests
  * Unit tests as symptoms of a larger problem
  * Bugs don't matter until they matter
  * The legacy of black box testability
