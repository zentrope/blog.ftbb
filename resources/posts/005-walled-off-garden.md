Can't change your variables once you assign a value? WTF? Surely, this
is something up with which we cannot put! Or: a round-about
introduction to some of the concerns addressed by the functional
programming paradigm.

**In This Episode:**

 - "I've been thinking about Object Oriented Programming."
 - "And you survived."
 - Concurrency and shared state
 - Changing the value of 2
 - What if we can't change a variable's value?
 - Side effects: minus the sides. And the effects.
 - A functional primer and the unit test
 - No side effects? No dependency injection!
 - Does dependency injection break the "encapsulation" contract?
 - Lock the doors so we can invent windows.
 - Mock object makes a mockery of ... well ....
 - Separating values from behavior
 - The inversion of the inversion
 - Apparently, we're really interested in address books.
 - What about side-effects, though? I mean, right?
 - Separating side-effects from calculations
 - A walled-off garden of perfection
 - Don't mock me
 - Recursion
 - When copying is not copying
 - What's the difference between antidote and poison?
 - Mocking and Dependency Injection, a heretical view
 - Rich Hickey, Simon Peyton Jones, Martin Ordesky
 - Clojure: What if I only use blue?
 - Scala: What if we add blue, and every other color, too?
 - After all this, why OO ever?
